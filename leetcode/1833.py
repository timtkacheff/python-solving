# It is a sweltering summer day, and a boy wants to buy some ice cream bars.
#
# At the store, there are n ice cream bars. You are given an array costs of length n,
# where costs[i] is the price of the ith ice cream bar in coins.
# The boy initially has coins [coins] to spend, and he wants to buy as many ice cream bars as possible.Â 
#
# Return the maximum number of ice cream bars the boy can buy with coins coins.
#
# Note: The boy can buy the ice cream bars in any order.
