# The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.
#
# Given two integers x and y, return the Hamming distance between them.

class Solution:
    def hammingDistance(self, x: int, y: int): # -> int:
        return bin(x ^ y).count("1")


sol = Solution()
print(sol.hammingDistance(3, 1))
